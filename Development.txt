The game is between two player , but for simplicity i will implement it to one playes in the begining .

-The game has two models Player and Game 

- Model game can hold information about the game like ball1, ball2, ball3 and score

- Model game should has fuctions like: strike?, spare?, calc_score , game_over?

- player will play the game as the following , he will press play button 
and then it will be created a game object that contain  ball1 and ball 2 
randomly and claculate scores 

- Im thinking if the game class will be Activerecord and have all the values and functions that required to play the game.

- The calculation of points calculations perform as the game rules
